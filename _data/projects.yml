- project: 메모리 제약을 위한 순서 증가 페이지 매핑 FTL 기법
  role: Developer
  duration: 2016 &mdash; 2017

  description: Unlike HDDs, SSDs cannot be overwritten, and read/write units and erase units are different. Because of these features, SSDs require a flash conversion layer. The algorithm of the flash conversion layer has a big impact on SSD performance. This study proposes an increasing order page-level mapping (IOPM) method that manages the mapping table through partitions, focusing on the high probability that inputs and outputs are transmitted in an increasing order. It led to an improvement in performance.

- project: Optimizing RocksDB for Better Read Throughput in Blockchain Systems
  role: Developer
  duration: 2018 &mdash; 2019
  url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8974829
  description: It aims to optimize RocksDB read behavior for blockchain workload. First, observe the characteristics of the blockchain workload and check the RocksDB architecture. Based on the observations on the blockchain workload characteristics and RocksDB architecture, we propose two optimization techniques to reduce parallel read and read disk IO. In particular, the first optimization technique is very effective in flash storage because it can use parallel processing techniques in flash storage. When the optimization technique proposed in this paper was applied, the increase or decrease of the read throughput was up to 30 times higher than that of the blockchain benchmark compared to RocksDB with the default setting applied.

- project: LADM, the CMS for LINE DSP
  role: Developer 
  duration: 2018 &mdash; Present
  description: By using JPA, the Java standard of ORM, the degree of understanding is improved. By developing the DSP CMS of LINE Advertising System, I can collaborate with various departments and gain knowledge about domains.

- project: Luda, Wedding Registry Platform
  role: Server Developer 
  duration: 2020 &mdash; Present
  description: Toy project. Understanding of Spring security has been improved by using OAuth for integrating the 3rd party Oauth systems. Functions provided by AWS or Git can be used instead of company's inside tools. 
  skill: Spring MVC, PostgresQL, MyBatis, Gradle, AWS, Git Actions, Spring security.
